# Employee-Attrition-Prediction 
"Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning with Power BI Dashboard"

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand attrition patterns and predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company. Machine learning models are used to forecast attrition, and results are visualized using Power BI to assist HR teams in decision-making.

 # Project Overview
Built multiple ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost to predict employee attrition.
Used an HR dataset that includes features like age, department, job role, salary, performance rating, job satisfaction, etc.
Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize key HR metrics and model results.
Provides business insights on employee retention based on data trends.

# Files in the Repository

WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv : Original HR dataset used for training and evaluation.

model_performance.csv : Summary of accuracy, precision, and recall for all trained models.

Task 1 dashboard.pbix : Power BI dashboard visualizing attrition insights, model results, and key metrics.

# Power BI Dashboard Includes:
Attrition rates by department, job role, gender, and education.
Age group distribution and income-level impact on attrition.
KPI summary cards for total employees, attrition rate, average income, and more.
Actual vs Predicted attrition comparison using ML outputs.
Model performance comparison for business interpretability
